# Paddle-API
Paddle API is a platform-provided interface that allows developers to integrate and manage payment-related functionalities for selling software, digital products, or subscriptions. Paddle simplifies global payments by offering features like subscriptions, one-time payments, tax handling, and compliance, making it easier for businesses to focus on their products without worrying about payment processing complexities.

The Paddle API is a set of RESTful endpoints and tools that developers use to interact programmatically with the Paddle platform.
